<h2>Description</h2>
<p style="color: red; background-color: antiquewhite; font-family: 'Arial', sans-serif;">When I was in middle school, before milk tea was a thing, not many people drank tea with milk. One of my classmates' mom opened
    a little shop that sold tea with milk. I tried theirs and did not like it. So I cooked my mine milk tea. They are simpler and
    unlike modern milk tea.
